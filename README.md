# Propagated-Image-Filtering

AIM:-The goal of the filter is  smoothing over neighboring image pixels while preserving image context like edges or textural regions. In particular, the filterdoes not utilize explicit spatial kernel functions as bilateral and guided filters do. The propagation filter can be viewed as a robust estimator, which minimizes the expected difference between the filtered and desirable image outputs.
